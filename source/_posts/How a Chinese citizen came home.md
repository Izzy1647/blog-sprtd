How a Chinese citizen came home

One night at about six months ago, when I was in Manchester, I randomly saw some beautiful pictures of Madeira Island online. After which I checked Ryanair.com, and booked a flight ticket to Madeira, departing on the very next day. Smooth process, and nice journey.

Another night at about two months ago, when I decided to travel back to China, I noticed that first of all, I couldn't find many available flights; secondly, these very limited available tickets were ridiculously expensive, say, 30,000 RMB or 3500 pounds from the UK to China, with one or more flight transfers. 

I was shocked, so I consulted some of my Chinese friends. They told me that if I was planning to fly to China in the next few weeks, it's already too late, and if I started preparing now, I might be able to travel within two months, with a relatively reasonable cost. It is not until I finally arrived at Beijing that I realized that the so called "relatively reasonable cost" is already ten times higher than regular days (i.e., non-covid times), and contains 14 days quarantine in total. 

I would love to share the whole story of how a Chinese citizen, i.e., me, can travel back to his own country.

So the very first step was to find a "flyable" flight. To provide some background knowledge, during covid, China's aviation regulator has launched "Five One Policy" that allows Chinese airlines to operate only one flight per week on one route to any country, which tremendously lower the number of available flights connecting China and the world. To make it even worse, there's another policy called circuit breaker, which  suspends one flight from operating for two to four weeks, if there are too many positive cases on the plane.
